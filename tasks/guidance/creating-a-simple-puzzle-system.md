# 🎯 Creating a Simple Puzzle System

## 📌 Task Description
Create a Blueprint-based puzzle system involving multiple interactable components. This task will test how well AI tools guide developers through building interconnected Blueprint logic.

## 🎯 Objective
- Create multiple **Blueprint Actors** (e.g., levers, buttons, or switches).  
- Link them to trigger a **Final Event** (e.g., unlocking a door or revealing a secret area).  
- Implement **Visual Feedback** when puzzle components are activated.  

## 🔨 Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.5 or later.  
- Familiarity with **Blueprint Communication and Events**.  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** How well the AI guides the user through creating the puzzle system.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the process and provides helpful tips or visuals.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the user successfully implements a working puzzle system.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** The AI’s ability to explain the Blueprint creation process clearly and concisely.  

## 📁 Example Blueprint Workflow
1. **Create Individual Blueprint Actors:**  
   - Each component (e.g., lever, button) should have a unique trigger logic.  
2. **Set Up Communication:**  
   - Use **Blueprint Interfaces or Event Dispatchers** for interactivity.  
3. **Implement Puzzle Logic:**  
   - Ensure components must be activated in a specific order.  
4. **Provide Feedback:**  
   - Use lights, sounds, or visual cues to indicate progress.  
5. **Finalize Puzzle System:**  
   - Trigger the final event upon successful puzzle completion.
