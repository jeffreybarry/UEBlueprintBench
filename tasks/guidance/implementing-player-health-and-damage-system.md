# 🎯 Implementing Player Health and Damage System

## 📌 Task Description
Create a Blueprint-based health and damage system for the player character. This task will test how well AI tools guide developers through building a simple combat system using Blueprints.

## 🎯 Objective
- Implement a **Health System** for the player.  
- Apply **Damage Logic** when the player is hit by enemies or environmental hazards.  
- Display **Health UI** to visualize remaining health.  

## 🔨 Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.5 or later.  
- Familiarity with **Blueprints, Variables, and UI Widgets**.  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** How well the AI guides the user through creating the health and damage system.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the process and provides helpful tips or visuals.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the user successfully implements a functioning health system.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** The AI’s ability to explain the Blueprint creation process clearly and concisely.  

## 📁 Example Blueprint Workflow
1. **Create Health Variable:**  
   - Add a `Health` variable to the Player Blueprint.  
   - Set initial health value and create functions to **Reduce, Restore, and Check Health**.  
2. **Implement Damage Logic:**  
   - Apply damage through **Collision or Overlap Events**.  
   - Implement responses to damage (e.g., flashing red UI, playing hurt animations).  
3. **Create Health UI:**  
   - Use **Widget Blueprints** to display the player's current health.  
   - Update UI in response to damage or healing.  
4. **Test and Refine:**  
   - Ensure health is reduced properly when the player is hit.
