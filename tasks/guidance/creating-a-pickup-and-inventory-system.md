# 🎯 Creating a Pickup and Inventory System

## 📌 Task Description
Create a Blueprint-based inventory system that allows the player to collect and store items. This task will test how well AI tools guide developers through building a basic inventory system using Blueprints.

## 🎯 Objective
- Create **Pickup Items** that the player can interact with.  
- Implement a **Simple Inventory System** to store collected items.  
- Display **Inventory UI** to visualize collected items.  

## 🔨 Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.5 or later.  
- Familiarity with **Blueprints, Arrays, and UI Widgets**.  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** How well the AI guides the user through creating the inventory system.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the process and provides helpful tips or visuals.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the user successfully implements a working inventory system.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** The AI’s ability to explain the Blueprint creation process clearly and concisely.  

## 📁 Example Blueprint Workflow
1. **Create Pickup Item Blueprints:**  
   - Add Static Meshes and Collision components.  
   - Implement interaction logic (e.g., `OnBeginOverlap` or `OnInteract` Event).  
2. **Create Inventory System:**  
   - Use **Arrays** to store collected items.  
   - Add functions to **Add, Remove, and Check Items**.  
3. **Create Inventory UI:**  
   - Use **Widget Blueprints** to display the inventory.  
   - Update UI when items are added or removed.  
4. **Test and Refine:**  
   - Ensure items are correctly added, removed, and displayed in the UI.
