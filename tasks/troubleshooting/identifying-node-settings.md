# 🐛 Identifying Node Settings

## 📌 Task Description
Assess whether the AI can accurately identify settings and properties of a specific Blueprint node from a screenshot. This baseline test will establish if the AI can recognize detailed properties within a node.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint node with expanded settings** (e.g., `Set Variable` node with a variable type dropdown visible).  
- The AI must identify the node and describe its **settings and configuration**.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of a Blueprint Node with Settings Visible** (e.g., variables, data types, function inputs/outputs).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify the node name.**  
2. **Describe the node’s purpose.**  
3. **List the settings and their current values as shown in the screenshot.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies all relevant settings and their values.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the node’s configuration.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI can correctly identify and explain the settings in each test case.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
