# 🐛 Identifying Node Functions and Inputs

## 📌 Task Description
Assess whether the AI can accurately identify Blueprint nodes that represent functions or custom events and describe their inputs and outputs. This is essential for verifying the AI’s ability to understand how functions are used within Blueprints.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint graph** with function nodes and their inputs/outputs.  
- The AI must identify the function, explain its purpose, and describe its inputs and outputs.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of Function Nodes** (e.g., `Custom Events`, `Built-in Functions`, `Blueprint Functions`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify the function node by name.**  
2. **Describe the purpose of the function.**  
3. **List all inputs and outputs, including their data types.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies functions and their inputs/outputs.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the purpose of the function.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI accurately describes the inputs and outputs of the function.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
