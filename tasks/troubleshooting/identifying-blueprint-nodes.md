# 🐛 Identifying Blueprint Nodes

## 📌 Task Description
Determine if the AI can accurately identify specific Blueprint nodes from a screenshot and provide correct descriptions of their purpose and settings. This is a baseline test to assess the AI’s fundamental ability to recognize visual Blueprint elements.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint node**.  
- The AI must identify the node, describe its purpose, and explain its settings.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of a Blueprint Node** (e.g., `Branch`, `Print String`, `Set Variable`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Correctly identify the Blueprint node by name.**  
2. **Describe the node’s purpose.**  
3. **Explain relevant settings and properties visible in the screenshot.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies the node and describes it accurately.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the node’s purpose and settings.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI correctly identifies the node in each test case.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
