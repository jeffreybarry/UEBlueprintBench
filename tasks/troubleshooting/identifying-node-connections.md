# 🐛 Identifying Node Connections

## 📌 Task Description
Assess whether the AI can accurately identify connections between Blueprint nodes and describe their purpose. This baseline test will establish if the AI can understand how nodes are linked and how data flows between them.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of connected Blueprint nodes**.  
- The AI must identify the nodes, describe their connections, and explain how they interact.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of Connected Nodes** (e.g., `Branch` -> `Print String` -> `Set Variable`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify all nodes in the screenshot.**  
2. **Describe the purpose of each connection.**  
3. **Explain how data or execution flow progresses through the connected nodes.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies all connections and their purpose.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the connections and data flow.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI can accurately describe the connections in each test case.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
