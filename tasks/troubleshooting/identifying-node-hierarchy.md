# 🐛 Identifying Node Hierarchy

## 📌 Task Description
Determine if the AI can accurately identify the hierarchy of Blueprint nodes within a Blueprint graph. This task will test the AI’s ability to recognize parent-child relationships and execution order.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint graph** with nodes connected in a hierarchical structure.  
- The AI must identify the nodes and explain their hierarchy and execution order.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of a Blueprint Graph** with multiple nodes connected in a logical sequence (e.g., `Event BeginPlay -> Branch -> Print String`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify all nodes in the graph.**  
2. **Explain the parent-child relationships between nodes.**  
3. **Describe the execution order based on node connections.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI accurately identifies the hierarchy and execution order.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the relationships between nodes.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI can correctly identify and describe the hierarchy.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
