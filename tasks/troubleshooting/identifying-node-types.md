# 🐛 Identifying Node Types

## 📌 Task Description
Assess whether the AI can accurately identify the type of Blueprint nodes based on their appearance and settings. This task ensures the AI can differentiate between various node types.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint graph** with various node types.  
- The AI must identify the node type and describe its purpose.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of Mixed Node Types** (e.g., `Event Nodes`, `Function Nodes`, `Variable Nodes`, `Macro Nodes`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify each node type (e.g., Event, Function, Macro, Variable).**  
2. **Describe the purpose of each node type.**  
3. **Explain relevant settings or configurations associated with each type.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies each node type.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the purpose of each node type.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI can accurately differentiate between node types.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
