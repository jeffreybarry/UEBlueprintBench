# 🐛 Identifying Variable References

## 📌 Task Description
Determine if the AI can accurately identify variable references within a Blueprint and explain their purpose and data type. This is essential for verifying the AI’s ability to understand data flow within Blueprints.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The developer provides a **screenshot of a Blueprint graph** containing variable references.  
- The AI must identify the variable, its type, and describe its usage within the graph.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of Blueprint Graph with Variable Nodes** (e.g., `Get Variable`, `Set Variable`).  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should:
1. **Identify the variable reference by name.**  
2. **Determine the data type of the variable (e.g., `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`).**  
3. **Explain how the variable is used within the Blueprint.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies variable references and their types.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the purpose of the variable.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the AI accurately describes the variable usage.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.
