# 🐛 Fixing Blueprint Communication Errors

## 📌 Task Description
A developer is experiencing issues with Blueprints failing to communicate properly. This task will evaluate how well AI tools assist developers in diagnosing and resolving communication errors between Blueprints.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- **Event Dispatchers, Blueprint Interfaces, or Cast To Nodes** are not working as intended.  
- The desired events are not being triggered or are triggering incorrectly.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshots of Blueprint Logic** where communication errors occur.  
- Description of the intended functionality.  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should guide the developer in:
1. **Identifying incorrect communication setups.**  
2. **Suggesting fixes and providing explanations.**  
3. **Explaining why certain approaches work better.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI correctly identifies the communication issue.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains troubleshooting steps.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the developer successfully resolves the communication problem.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.  

## 📂 Possible Issues to Check
1. **Event Dispatcher Binding Issues:** Ensure correct binding and unbinding.  
2. **Blueprint Interface Setup:** Verify interface implementation and function calls.  
3. **Cast To Node Errors:** Check validity of object references.
