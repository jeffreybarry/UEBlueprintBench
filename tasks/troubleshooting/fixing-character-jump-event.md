# 🐛 Fixing a Character Jump Event

## 📌 Task Description
A developer has implemented a character jump event using Blueprints, but the jump is not triggering when the player presses the jump button. This task will evaluate how well AI tools assist developers in diagnosing and resolving the issue based on a screenshot of the problematic Blueprint.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- The jump event is supposed to trigger when the player presses the **Spacebar**.
- The Blueprint uses a **InputAction Jump** node connected to a **Jump** node.
- The character **does not respond** when the jump button is pressed during gameplay.

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of the Blueprint** where the problem occurs (to be provided by the developer).
- **Blueprint Class:** Character Blueprint (inherits from `Character` class).
- **Input Action Mapping:** InputAction Jump mapped to the **Spacebar** in the Project Settings.

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should guide the developer in:
1. **Identifying potential issues** (e.g., incorrect input mappings, missing nodes, faulty connections).  
2. **Suggesting step-by-step troubleshooting methods**.  
3. **Providing clear explanations of why certain approaches may resolve the problem**.  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI accurately identifies the issue based on the provided screenshot.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the troubleshooting process and provides actionable guidance.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the developer successfully fixes the jump event issue.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.  

## 📂 Possible Issues to Check
1. **Input Mapping Issues:** Ensure the `InputAction Jump` is properly mapped in the Project Settings.  
2. **Event Graph Setup:** Verify that the `InputAction Jump` node is correctly connected to the `Jump` node.  
3. **Collision Settings:** Check if collision settings are interfering with the jump action.  
4. **Blueprint Execution Order:** Ensure there are no blocking nodes or conditions preventing the jump.
