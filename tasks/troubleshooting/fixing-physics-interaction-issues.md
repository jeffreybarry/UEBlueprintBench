# 🐛 Fixing Physics Interaction Issues

## 📌 Task Description
A developer is experiencing issues with physics-based interactions not behaving as expected (e.g., objects not colliding, bouncing incorrectly, or getting stuck). This task will evaluate how well AI tools assist developers in diagnosing and resolving physics-related issues.

## 🔍 Problem Details
- Physics interactions between objects are not working as intended.  
- Issues may involve **Collision Settings, Physics Constraints, or Blueprint Logic**.  

## 📁 Provided Resources
- **Screenshot of Physics Settings or Blueprint Logic.**  
- Description of the intended interaction behavior.  

## 🔨 Expected Outcome
The AI should guide the developer in:
1. **Identifying incorrect physics settings.**  
2. **Suggesting fixes and providing explanations.**  
3. **Explaining why certain approaches work better.**  

## 📐 Evaluation Criteria
- 📐 **Accuracy:** Whether the AI accurately identifies the physics issue.  
- 📝 **Clarity:** How well the AI explains the troubleshooting process.  
- 📌 **Task Success Rate:** Whether the developer successfully resolves the physics interaction issue.  
- 💬 **Comprehensibility Score:** Clarity and conciseness of the AI’s explanation.  

## 📂 Possible Issues to Check
1. **Collision Channels:** Verify objects are set to interact with each other.  
2. **Physics Constraints:** Ensure proper constraints are applied where needed.  
3. **Blueprint Logic:** Check for overrides or conflicting logic affecting physics.
